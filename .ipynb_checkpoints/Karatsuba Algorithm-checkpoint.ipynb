    "* Flow of the Algorithm:\n",
    "  1. Input two numbers. \n",
    "  2. Check if the length of either of the number is less then 10 i.e., if any of the number is of single digit. If yes then we can perform direct multiplication. This will be our base case of the the recursive function. \n",
    "  3. If the numbers are not single digits, then we start with the Karatsuba algorithm. \n",
    "  4. Find the maximum number of digits from eith of the number.\n",
    "  5. Check if the max number of digits is an even or odd number. \n",
    "     * If it is an odd number then you will have to reduce the number by one and then divide the result by two and save it in another variable. \n",
    "     * If it is an even number then you directly divide the number by two and save it in another variable.\n",
    "  6. The number generated after dividing the max length of the either number by two will be helpful while padding the individual results with zeros. The of check will help to compensate for the problem when trying to divide an odd number with two. \n",
    "  7. Now you can form the upper and lower halfs of both the numbers by taking the division of the number by 10^(max length of wither number/two) and the modules of the number with 10^(max length of wither number/two). Repeat this step for both the numbers. \n",
    "  8. Now you have a, b, c, and d. Compute ac, cd and ad + cd. Resursively call the function and pass the values of a, b, c, and d generated in the previous step. \n",
    "  9. At the end of recursion you will have your product of two large numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Things to keep in mind:\n",
    "  1. The max length of either numbers must be chaecked for odd and even. If it is odd then do convert it to even because padding is done in multiples of two.\n",
    "  2. len() finction doesnot work on int. Take care of the data type and convert int to str and vice vera when required. "
